# TPySA: A Python implementation of the two-point stress approximation for linearized elasticity

This is a Python implementation of the TPSA method presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10390.
The code in this repository is developed to solve the linearized Biot poroelasticity equations by iteratively coupling TPSA with OPM Flow.
